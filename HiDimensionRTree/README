This library implements a high-dimensional Rtree. It is aimed to maintain a high performance Java version of the RTree spatial indexing algorithm as described in the 1984 paper "R-trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching" by Antonin Guttman.

Meanwhile, Java Generics is introduced to guarantee any data type could be index for RTree.

Briefly, use "make compile" to compile the code, and "make rtreeMain" to execute a example rTree.
